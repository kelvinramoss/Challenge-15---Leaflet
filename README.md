# Challenge-15---Leaflet

## Background

The US Geological Survey (USGS) helps us understand things like natural disasters, how healthy our environment is, and how things like climate change affect the Earth. They're looking to make new tools to show their earthquake info better. Every day, they gather loads of data from everywhere but struggle to show it in a helpful way. In this job, the goal is to finnd a way to make this data visual so they can teach people and government groups more effectively (and maybe get more money for their work).

## Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

1. Grab your dataset from the USG GeoJSON Feed.

2. Import it and display the information visually.
    -  With Leaflet, make a map that marks all the earthquakes using their longitude and latitude. 
    - Make sure the markers show extra details about each earthquake when clicked. 
    - Also, add a legend to explain what the map is showing.
